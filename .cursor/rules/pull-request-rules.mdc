# Pull Request Guidelines

When creating or updating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to compare the current branch with main
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact

## Pull Request Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Body: Bullet list of changes only (with NO extra lines between bullet points)
- Do NOT repeat the title in the body
- No additional text or explanations

## Example:
```
Title: Add user authentication to login page

Body:
- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials
```

## PR Description Formatting
When creating a PR, ensure that:
- The title is not repeated in the body
- All bullet points are written without extra lines between them
- The body starts directly with bullet points (no introductory text)
- When using GitHub CLI, use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid escape character issues
In GitHub or similar platforms, preview the PR description to verify there are no unwanted
line breaks between bullet points.

## Process
1. Analyze changes between main and current branch
2. Create PR title and bullet list description
3. Create new PR or update existing PR tied to current branch
4. Request review if needed
