# Pull Request Guidelines

When creating or updating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to compare the current branch with main
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact

## Pull Request Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Body: 
  - Bullet list of changes (with NO extra lines between bullet points)
  - After the list, add a brief explanation of why this PR is needed
- Do NOT repeat the title in the body

## Example:
```
Title: Add user authentication to login page

Body:
- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials

This feature is necessary to secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access to the application.
```

## PR Description Formatting
When creating a PR, ensure that:
- The title is not repeated in the body
- All bullet points are written without extra lines between them
- The body starts directly with bullet points (no introductory text)
- When using GitHub CLI, use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid escape character issues
- Always create the PR body file in the `/tmp/` folder (e.g., `/tmp/pr-body.md`)
In GitHub or similar platforms, preview the PR description to verify there are no unwanted
line breaks between bullet points.

## Process
1. Analyze changes between origin/main and current branch
2. Create PR title and bullet list description
3. Create new PR or update existing PR tied to current branch
4. Request review if needed
