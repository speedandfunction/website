# Pull Request Guidelines

When creating or updating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to compare the current branch with main
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact

## Pull Request Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Body: Bullet list of changes only
- No additional text or explanations

## Example:
```
Add user authentication to login page

- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials
```

## Process
1. Analyze changes between main and current branch
2. Create PR title and bullet list description
3. Create new PR or update existing PR tied to current branch
4. Request review if needed
