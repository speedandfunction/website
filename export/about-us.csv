At Speed & Function, we believe technology should evolve with the people building and using it, not just meet a spec.

Our goal is to help mission-driven organizations create real impact by working better: more aligned, more adaptive, and more human.

That’s why we’ve spent the last 17+ years developing not just custom software — but more intentional teams, stronger partnerships, and systems that last.

We’re also a Deliberately Developmental Organization (DDO), which means feedback, reflection, and shared ownership are built into how we work. Internally and externally, we create environments where growth is expected, supported, and embedded in how we deliver.

We partner with purpose-driven teams who want more than output. They want long-term thinking, thoughtful collaboration, and a process that helps everyone evolve. 
Here’s what we value most: 
Every project is a chance to grow: as engineers, partners, and people. 
True integration means shared context, shared tools, and shared responsibility. 
Growth requires change. We build teams and systems that respond well to both. 
We follow through, speak up, and stay aligned even when things get messy.",false,2025-04-25T09:13:50.061Z,"[""clt4cxwo20003g5kq78bidxpe""]","[""/about-us""]",false,"{""username"":""editor"",""title"":""editor"",""_id"":""em67bj48h2p0skcip9tz4dj2"",""updatedAt"":""2025-04-23T16:38:50.143Z""}",,
