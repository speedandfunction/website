Description: Suggested replacing forEach with for...of loop to avoid anti-pattern in parseArguments function
----
Using forEach for control flow with early returns or exceptions is an anti-pattern. Consider using a for...of loop which allows proper control flow.
```suggestion
  for (const arg of args) {
    if (arg.startsWith('--env=')) options.envPath = arg.split('=')[1];
    else if (arg === '--help' || arg === '-h') options.help = true;
    else if (arg === '--dry-run') options.dryRun = true;
    else if (arg === '--verbose' || arg === '-v') options.verbose = true;
    else if (arg.startsWith('--')) throw new Error(`Unknown argument: ${arg}`);
  }
```
----
Status: OUTDATED - The forEach loop has been replaced with a for...of loop as suggested

Description: Fix error counting in batch processing when insertMany fails with some successful insertions
----
**Fix error counting in batch processing.**

When `insertMany` fails with `ordered: false`, some documents may still be inserted successfully. The current implementation counts all documents in the batch as errors, which is incorrect.

```diff
 try {
-  await targetCol.insertMany(batch, { ordered: false });
+  const result = await targetCol.insertMany(batch, { ordered: false });
 processed += batch.length;
   
   if (verbose) {
     process.stdout.write(`\r   Progress: ${processed}/${count}`);
   }
 } catch (error) {
-  errors += batch.length;
-  if (verbose) console.error(`\n⚠️  Batch error: ${error.message}`);
+  // For BulkWriteError, writeErrors contains the actual failed documents
+  if (error.name === 'BulkWriteError' && error.result) {
+    const successCount = error.result.nInserted || 0;
+    processed += successCount;
+    errors += batch.length - successCount;
+    if (verbose) console.error(`\n⚠️  Batch partially failed: ${successCount}/${batch.length} inserted`);
+  } else {
+    errors += batch.length;
+    if (verbose) console.error(`\n⚠️  Batch error: ${error.message}`);
+  }
 }
```
----
Status: OUTDATED - This suggestion refers to old code that has been reformatted, and the insertMany batch error handling is now outdated

## ✅ STILL RELEVANT (Need to be fixed):

### **website/scripts/s3-copy.js:42** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQm-G
Author: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
Description: Temporal coupling issue where dotenv.config() call depends on environment variables before they are loaded
----
The dotenv.config() call occurs after the config object is defined but before environment variables are accessed. This creates a temporal coupling issue where the config getters depend on environment variables that may not be loaded yet.
```suggestion
const envPath = getEnvPath();
require('dotenv').config({ path: envPath });
```
----
Status: RELEVANT - The dotenv configuration is still called after the config object definition on line 42, creating a temporal coupling issue where environment variables might not be loaded when getters are accessed
Recommendation: Move the dotenv.config() call to execute before the config object definition to ensure environment variables are available when needed
Decision: Fix this

### **website/scripts/s3-copy.js:48** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQm-W
Author: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
Description: Magic number 3 for COPY_BATCH_SIZE should be documented or made configurable via environment variable
----
[nitpick] The magic number 3 for COPY_BATCH_SIZE should be documented or made configurable. This value significantly impacts performance and should explain the reasoning behind this specific choice.
```suggestion
 * Number of files to copy concurrently per batch.
 * Default value is 3, which balances performance and resource usage for typical workloads.
 * Users can override this value by setting the environment variable COPY_BATCH_SIZE.
 */
const COPY_BATCH_SIZE = parseInt(process.env.COPY_BATCH_SIZE, 10) || 3;
```
----
Status: RELEVANT - COPY_BATCH_SIZE is still hardcoded as 3 with basic documentation but no environment variable configurability
Recommendation: Add environment variable support to make the batch size configurable for different environments and performance needs
Decision: Resolve this, at the moment hardcoded COPY_BATCH_SIZE is fine, no need to change it.

### **website/scripts/mongo-migrate.js:5** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQm-j
Author: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
Description: Magic number 1000 for BATCH_SIZE should be documented or made configurable via environment variable
----
[nitpick] The magic number 1000 for BATCH_SIZE should be documented or made configurable. Different environments may benefit from different batch sizes based on memory constraints and network conditions.
```suggestion
const BATCH_SIZE = parseInt(process.env.BATCH_SIZE, 10) || 1000;
```
----
Status: RELEVANT - BATCH_SIZE is still hardcoded as 1000 without environment variable configurability
Recommendation: Make the batch size configurable via environment variable to allow optimization for different environments
Decision: Resolve this, at the moment hardcoded BATCH_SIZE is fine, no need to change it.

### **website/package.json:41** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQqYR
Author: coderabbitai
Description: Invalid AWS SDK version 3.850.0 that does not exist on npm registry
----
**Invalid @aws-sdk/client-s3 version in package.json**

The declared dependency `"@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.850.0"` does not exist on npm.  
- As of July 22, 2025, npm's latest published version is **3.830.0**.  
- Snyk reports version **3.846.0** with no known vulnerabilities.

Please update your dependency to a valid, up-to-date release, for example:  
```diff
– "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.850.0",
+ "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.830.0",    # or ^3.846.0 for the Snyk-verified latest
```  
This will ensure your S3 client resolves correctly and includes the most recent security fixes.
----
Status: RELEVANT - The package.json still contains the invalid version "^3.850.0" for @aws-sdk/client-s3
Recommendation: Update to a valid version such as "^3.846.0" or the latest available stable version
Decision: Fix this, find correct most recent version

### **website/scripts/s3-copy.js:39** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQqYo
Author: coderabbitai
Description: AWS credentials should be validated before use to prevent exposure in error messages
----
**Add credential validation to prevent exposure in error messages.**

AWS credentials should be validated before use to avoid exposing them in error stack traces.

```diff
 get credentials() {
+  const validateCredentials = (creds, type) => {
+    if (!creds.accessKeyId || !creds.secretAccessKey) {
+      throw new Error(`Missing AWS ${type} credentials`);
+    }
+    if (creds.accessKeyId.length < 16 || creds.secretAccessKey.length < 20) {
+      throw new Error(`Invalid AWS ${type} credential format`);
+    }
+    return creds;
+  };
  
   return {
-    source: {
+    source: validateCredentials({
       region: process.env.AWS_SOURCE_REGION || 'us-east-1',
       accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_SOURCE_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
       secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SOURCE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
-    },
-    dest: {
+    }, 'source'),
+    dest: validateCredentials({
       region: process.env.AWS_DEST_REGION || 'us-east-1',
       accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_DEST_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
       secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_DEST_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
-    },
+    }, 'destination'),
   };
 },
```
----
Status: RELEVANT - The credentials getter still returns raw credentials without validation, potentially exposing sensitive information in error messages
Recommendation: Add credential validation to ensure credentials are present and valid before returning them
Decision: Fix this

### **website/scripts/s3-copy.js:131** 
Id: PRRT_kwDOOXKRxs5VQqYx
Author: coderabbitai
Description: streamToBuffer function lacks protection against large data and indefinite streaming without timeout
----
**Add timeout and size limits for stream processing.**

The `streamToBuffer` function could consume excessive memory for large objects and has no timeout protection.

```diff
-streamToBuffer(stream) {
+streamToBuffer(stream, maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) { // 5GB default
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     const chunks = [];
+    let totalSize = 0;
+    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
+      stream.destroy();
+      reject(new Error('Stream processing timeout'));
+    }, 300000); // 5 minute timeout
+    
     stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
+      totalSize += chunk.length;
+      if (totalSize > maxSize) {
+        stream.destroy();
+        clearTimeout(timeout);
+        reject(new Error(`Object size exceeds limit of ${maxSize} bytes`));
+        return;
+      }
       chunks.push(chunk)
     });
-    stream.on('end', () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks)));
-    stream.on('error', reject);
+    stream.on('end', () => {
+      clearTimeout(timeout);
+      resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks));
+    });
+    stream.on('error', (err) => {
+      clearTimeout(timeout);
+      reject(err);
+    });
   });
 },
```
----
Status: RELEVANT - The streamToBuffer function on line 124 still lacks timeout and memory protection mechanisms
Recommendation: Add timeout handling and memory size limits to prevent excessive memory usage and hanging streams
Decision: Resolve this. it works good enough, and mistake (even if happed) wouldn't cause any damadge.
